I- Concatenation

Concatenation is used to link between two data. The operator to link in JavaScript languague is (+)
e.g
    let a = "myName is"
    let b = "Mohamed"
to link these two variables and print them on html page:
    console.log(a + b)

but, the output wont contain a space between these space "myName isMohamed "
to make a space u can use [ console.log(a + " " + b) ] or u can add new variable conatain space:
    console.log(a + c + b) ( c = " " )

or to ignore all of these use:
    console.log(a, b)




II- Template Literal

we have these variables
    let x = "we love"
    let y = "JavaScript"
    let z = "and"
    let u = "Programming"

The legacy way to link these vars is:
    console.log(x + " \"\" " + y + "\n" + z + " " + u)
    -> /n for linebreak & \"\" for adding "" to print


but using ES6 standards and above:
    console.log(`${x} "" ${y}
    ${z} ${u}`)

-> by using [ `` ] backtick and [ ${} ] to add variables and conditions
-> to add double quotes or space u can add them directely
-> and for lineBreak, just hit enter.
