when you type:  
    console.log("a string "other string"")

this will show error because u set a double quote inside a double quote. the same thing will happen with the single quotes

double quote inside a single quote will make no error, single quote inside a double quote will make no error, the error will show when you set the same type of quotation.

To ignore or escape that use the backslash mark "\"
the backslash will ignore the next character
    e.g console.log("strinnnngs \"word\"")

then, if you want to print the backslash, type another backslash before it.
    e.g console.log("mohamed \\ said")

another use case:
    console.log("sequences \
    of \ 
    strings")

to add new line use \n : 
    console.log("sequences \n of \n string")

to add indent tab use \t :
    console.log("\t sequences of string")
