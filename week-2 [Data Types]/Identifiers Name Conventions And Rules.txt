There are two limitation on variables names in JavaScript:
    - The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symboles "$" and "_".
    - The first character must not be a digit.

When name contains multiple words, cameCase is cammonly used "myVeryLongName".

The dollar sign "$" and the underscore "_" can also be used in names. They are regular symbols, just like letters.

Variables named "apple" and "APPLE" are two different variables

Non-latin letter are allowed but not recommended

There are list of reserved words, which cannot be used as variables names because they are used by the language itself.
For example: "let", "var", "function".
